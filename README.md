## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for the project. The dataset comprises images for a computer vision task.
- `eda.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset.
- `unsupervised_eda.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the unsupervised learning performed on the dataset.
- `VGG_state_of_the_art_model.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the pre-trained VGG model.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Ensure Kaggle is installed in the environment via `pip install kaggle`
   - If not done, the dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) and the zip file can be read by adjusting file paths as necessary.
2. Ensure the environment has the following packages installed: Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Glob, Matplotlib, Pandas.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook files.
